## 🧠 About Me  
I am a mathematics student at Ruhr University Bochum, expecting to complete my Master’s in March 2026. During my studies in Bochum and Barcelona, I developed a strong passion for research in numerical mathematics.

I am particularly interested in **Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra**, **Finite Element Methods**, **High Performance Computing** and **Deep Learning**. I have conducted research in these areas through my Master’s and Bachelor’s theses as well as my work as a student researcher.

In parallel, I have gained over three years of experience as a student software engineer, which allowed me to develop practical skills and explore real-world applications of my knowledge.
